# Stress Fractures in Men and Women undergoing Military Training
[Protzman & Griffis 1977](../References/Protzman1977Stress.pdf)

### Notes
Short and sweet 1-pager:
- TIL that in 1976, the first group of women were accepeted into the United States Military Academy.
- This paper follows this event, comparing stress fracture incidence in men and women under the same training requirements:
    - 8-week summer training
    - daily morning runs, increasing gradually to 4 miles at 7:30 pace.
    - Marches: "A total of 57 miles and a final march of 14 miles in one day, performed with 35lbs pack." I think this is 
    57 miles over the course of 8 weeks.
    - 21 field training sessions

**10 of 102 women developed stress fractures, 12 of 1228 men developed stress fractures.**
