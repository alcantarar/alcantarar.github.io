# Overuse Injuries of the lower extremities associated with marching, jogging, and running: a review
[Jones 1983](../References/Jones1983Overuse.pdf)

### Notes
Skipped some of the incidence data, been a lot of it lately. Focused on risk factors.

#### Footwear
Quotes Cavanagh on how there's no controlled studies that have looked at footwear effects on injury yet. Combat boots
might be a risk factor, but we can't say for sure. We do know that they are less flexible and absorb less shock than
running shoes. 
#### Training
>As with footwear, there is very little substantive information regarding the impact of training techniques on overuse injuries.

Pollock (1977) found that limiting the frequency and duration of training might improve injury rates without affecting
aerobic training effects. 

- Scully reports decreasing stress fracture rates by not running or marching during the third week of basic training. 
- Yanklowitz "felt that they could significantly reduce the number of stress fractures in basic trainees by separating 
physical training and drill and ceremony sessions by eight hours, and by prohibiting physical training episodes of greater
than two hours during the first three weeks of basic training". Overall, they suggest that modifying training may help
reduce stress fracture risk in military recruits.
