# Injuries to runners
[James et al 1978](../References/James1978Injuries.pdf)

### Notes
Seems a bit dated with the emphasis on skeletal alignment, but it could just be me. I'm coming from the "preferred movement path" camp.
Paper starts off with how to examine runners and measure alignment of ankle under the assumption that a subtalar joint
in "neutral position" is best.

Biomechanically, rapid, excessive, and prolonged pronation is bad because you want a rigid (re: supinated) foot for
pushoff. 

When the foot pronates, the tibia internally rotates. This rotation occurs at the knee and they think it's the cause
for knee injury prevalence in runners.

On training errors, Bill Bowerman is mentioned: 
>Each
runner must determine the mileage that his body
can tolerate and not attempt to emulate accomplished
runners who thrive on high mileage.
William Bowerman, former track coach at the
University of Oregon and the 1972 Menâ€™s Olympic
Team Coach, has coached more sub-4 min
milers than any other coach in history. He has
indicated .that his milers generally never ran
more than 70 miles per week, and does not feel
that any additional mileage would have enhanced
their performances. In fact, he quite strongly
feels that additional mileage would have been
deletorious.

Of the injuries, they mention "posterior tibial syndrome", which is apparently pain on the back of your tibia. I 
feel like this is hard to actually identify since tibialis posterior is deep to gastrocnemius and soleus. Seems like
they just don't like the phrase "shin splints". It was at this point that I realized this paper wasn't exactly what
I was looking for.
