# Impact Forces During Heel-Toe Running
[Nigg, Cole, & Bruggemann 1995](../References/Nigg1995Impact.pdf)

### Notes
Review of current state of running injuries from a biomechanics perspective. Benno has done so much work in footwear,
that the focus here is primarily impact forces. However, general observations about the role of muscle
and bone remodeling are included. He says the jury is still out on impact forces as a factor for developing running-related injuries.
