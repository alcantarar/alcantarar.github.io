# Lower Extremity Stress Fractures in Athletes
[Taunton et al 1981](../References/Tauton1981Lower.pdf)

### Abstract Notes:
- Review of medical records for 43 (24 >50km/wk, 19 <30km/wk) runners treated for stress fractures
- Blame **training** increases for 44% of the stress fractures, all had "alignment problems".
- Treatment: Rest, muscle rehab, and orthotics to correct excessive pronation/flat feet.

### Review

##### Physiological Factors
Osteoclasts remove bone at microdamage sites (targeted remodeling?), and the development of new (stronger) bone lags behind. During this time, the bone is 
weakened. It's thought that during this time bone is susceptible to fracture. Resting allows for the bone to be completely
remodeled.

##### Etiological Factors
Overview of Frankel's Four horsemen of stress fractures:
1. Overload/Bowing of bone caused by muscle contraction (see Stanitski et al, also Devas)
2. Bone stress distribution is affected by muscle fatigue (see Clement, measured gastroc/TA girth)
3. Change in running surface
4. High repitition of stress (even low magnitude)

*Frankel compares fractures on tension vs compression side of bone.*

##### Biomechanics
Focus on how eversion of the foot reduces the rigidity of the foot ("unlocks" midtarsal joint) which is good for stability
but not great as a lever arm. Supination occurs begins mid/late stance so plantar flexors have "rigid lever am on which to
work for propulsion."

- Windlass mechanism theory: rigid soles prevent bending at MTPJ, which stresses the bow of plantar fascia/metatarsals.

### Methods: 
62 athletes, 43 runners from 10/1977-6/1978

### Results: 
- 34/62 stress fractures were on tibia (14 midshaft, 14 distal third)
- Average time from pain to going to clinic was 7.4 weeks, returned to activity ~5 weeks
- 27% followed rapid start of training
- pretty much everyone had flat feet when load bearing. 

### Discussion:
The "ideal foot" is not a flat foot. The "ideal leg" is not internally rotated. 

OMG there is a "terrible triad" apparently explaining why women get more stress fractures than men:
1. wide pelvis
1. coxa vara (angle between femur axis and femoral neck axis is <120 deg)
1. genu valgum (knock knee)
