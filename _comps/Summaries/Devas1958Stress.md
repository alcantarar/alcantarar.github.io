# Stress fractures of the tibia in athletes or "shin soreness"
### [Devas 1958](../References/Devas1958Stress.pdf)

Focus is on radiology of stress fractures, but has a cool table summarizing tibial stress fractures in athletes/recruits
from 1938-1958:

Crazy note about reproducing the pain associated with a stress fracture:
>It's possible to reproduce the pain in some patients by "springing" the tibia. This has to be done by straining the tibia 
>against a fulcrum (such as the knee of a surgeon) placed against the outer side of the leg at the level of tenderness;
>when the leg, held at the knee and the ankle, is pressed on to this fulcrum a fracture through the medial cortex of the
>tibia is opened and pain occurs

:astonished:
 
 They talk about how it's possible that strong **calf muscles could cause the tibia to bend**, alluding to the idea that 
 muscle forces may be a mechanism for stress fractures. Referenced by the Bone Bending paper with Trudeau and Weir on it 
 (first author Rice maybe?). 
 
 **Treatment** for stress fracture: Rest. 
 
 Many of these older studies are focused on the military and coincide with WWII. This paper associates stress fractures
 with shin soreness in athletes.
