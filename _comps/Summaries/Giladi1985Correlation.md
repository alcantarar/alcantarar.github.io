# The Correlation between Cumulative March Training and Stress Fractures in Soldiers
[Giladi et al 1985](../References/Giladi1985Correlation.pdf)

### Notes

### Purpose
Test hypothesis that stress fracture incidence is proportional to amount of cumulative physical training stresses.

### Methods
- Two groups of military trainees were followed for the first 11 weeks of basic training.
- **GROUP 1:** gradually increased marching distance up to 110km (cumulative)
- **GROUP 2:** less gradually increased marching distance up to 168km (cumulative)
- both groups' marches were with a 20kg pack
- Soldiers with pain were x-rayed and bone scanned

### Results
- No differences in incidence between groups or stress fracture location: 72% tibia, 25% femur, 2% metatarsals
- peak incidence was week 5 - week 8
- onset of fractures were 2x greater in group 2 during the first 4 weeks (group 1 marched 27km, group 2 marched 64km)


### Discussion
Seems like they're about to give up on preventing stress fractures:
> The goals of producing a top quality combat soldier and minimizing stress fractures in military trainees may be 
>dimetrically opposed.

- A 35% decrease in cumulative marching distance and more gradual increase in mileage did not improve stress fracture incidence
