# External Rotation of the Hip
## A Predictor of Risk for Stress Fractures
### [Giladi et al. 1987](../References/Giladi1987External.pdf)

Military study looking at 295 male Israeli recruits through 14 weeks of basic training. Performed basic anthropometrics 
prior to basic training, used xray to find stress fractures throughout basic training. Those with hip external rotation 
greater than 65 deg had 1.8 times higher incidence of stress fractures (mostly tibial & femoral) than those with less
than 65 deg. Mean (of both limbs but say that single limb was also valid) hip external rotation measured with hip flexed
 to 90 deg. 
 
 Authors suggest prescreening for external hip rotation can help predict those at high risk of stress fractures.
 Joint laxity and ankle/subtalar/hip joint RoM was similar between groups. They conclude that the Israeli army has more
 people with high hip external rotation and that's why they get more stress fractures than the American army.
