### Notes
Descriptive study on stress fractures in athletes. Most injured bone was the tibia (49% of injuries) and 221 of 320 were runners.

>In contrast to the military population, the athlete is fit and has osseous system adaptations that have occurred over a
>longer period of time.

I think this is an interesting point. Runners who get stress fractures aren't the same as a person undergoing an intense
11 week training regimen. However, maybe a freshman in a collegiate XC program is more comparable to military trainees... 

Summarizing the state of the literature to this point:

>Two main theories are currently used to explain the
etiology of stress fractures in athletes. The first is that
muscle weakness reduces the shock absorption of the lower
extremity and allows the redistribution of forces to bone,
increasing the stress at focal points in the bone.14,28 This is
supported by Skinner’s calculations on femoral neck stress
fractures in runners. 16 He found that the stress applied to
the femoral neck in running was well below the single cycle
failure load, and that stress fracture therefore must have
been the result of muscle fatigue during long runs. The
second theory is that muscle pull across a bone produces
enough repetitive force to create stress fracture.23,’9 This is
supported by the occurrence of stress fractures in nonweightbearing
upper extremity bones such as the humerus in a
baseball pitcher. While the relative contribution of each
mechanism to the etiology of stress fracture is unknown, it
is likely that both play a part. Periostitis, however, probably
results solely from the pull of muscles at their insertion in
bone.
