I'm currently a Biomechanics PhD student at the University of Colorado Boulder in Dr. Alena Grabowski's Applied Biomechanics Laboratory. 
My research interests include footwear biomechanics, running-related injuries, and sprinting mechanics. 
I like to run, snowboard, play Dungeons & Dragons, and program in my spare time.

In 2015 I completed a BSc in Applied Human Physiology at Seattle Pacific University, where I worked with [Dr. Cara Wall-Scheffler](https://wallscheffler.wordpress.com/) 
to investigate the physiological and biomechanical effects of pushing a stroller while running.
After graduating from SPU, I worked as a researcher in the Biomechanics Lab at Brooks Running, where I investigated the effects of footwear on running injury and performance.
In 2019 I completed a Masters degree at CU Boulder in 2019, where I investigated the effects of running prosthetic leg mass on running economy and biomechanical asymmetry.
