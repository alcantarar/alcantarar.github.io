## Hello World!
I'm a biomechanics researcher enthusiastic about wearable devices and product development.
I've published research in the areas of running-related bone stress injuries, machine learning, footwear biomechanics, sprinting mechanics, and signal processing. This site is a bit skeletal since departing academia but I frequent [twitter](https://twitter.com/Ryan_Alcantara_).
