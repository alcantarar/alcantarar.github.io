I’m currently a member of Dr. Alena Grabowski’s [Applied Biomechanics Laboratory](https://www.colorado.edu/iphy/research/applied-biomechanics-lab) at the University of Colorado Boulder. Previously, I worked as a researcher in the [Biomechanics Lab at Brooks Running](http://talk.brooksrunning.com/blog/2014/10/15/brooks-knows-whats-next/) and investigated the metabolic and kinematic responses to running with a stroller under the mentorship of [Dr. Cara Wall-Scheffler](https://wallscheffler.wordpress.com/) at Seattle Pacific University. Overall, my research interests include sport biomechanics, footwear development, and exercise physiology. [ryanalcantara.wordpress.com](ryanalcantara.wordpress.com) is the old version of this site.
