<br>
I'm currently a Biomechanics PhD candidate at the University of Colorado Boulder in Dr. Alena Grabowski's [Applied Biomechanics Laboratory](https://www.colorado.edu/iphy/research/applied-biomechanics-lab). 
My research interests include footwear biomechanics, running-related injuries, and sprinting mechanics. 
I like to run, snowboard, play Dungeons & Dragons, and program in my spare time. Check out some of the 
[projects](https://alcantarar.github.io/projects/) I've been working on or [follow me](https://twitter.com/Ryan_Alcantara_) on twitter!
