## Welcome!
I'm a biomechanist enthusiastic about research software, reproducibility, and data science. I actively use python, R, MATLAB, and git in my research and like enjoy developing statistical models and developing research software. My interests include machine learning, wearable devices, and running injury, which I'm combining to quantify stress fracture risk in U.S. collegiate cross country athletes. 

### What am I up to?
I'm currently a Biomechanics PhD candidate at the University of Colorado Boulder in Dr. Alena Grabowski's [Applied Biomechanics Laboratory](https://www.colorado.edu/iphy/research/applied-biomechanics-lab). 
My research interests include footwear biomechanics, running-related injuries, and sprinting mechanics. Check out some of the 
[projects](https://alcantarar.github.io/projects/) I've been working on or [follow me](https://twitter.com/Ryan_Alcantara_) on twitter!
<br>    
I've recently gotten interested in research software, developing [Dryft](https://github.com/alcantarar/dryft#dryft), an open source python/MATLAB package to process force-measuring treadmill data. 
<br>    
When I'm not working, I enjoy running, snowboarding, playing Dungeons & Dragons, and helping researchers with their programming problems.
