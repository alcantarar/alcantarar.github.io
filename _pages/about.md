## Hello World!
I'm a biomechanist enthusiastic about research software, reproducibility, and data science. 
I actively use python, R, MATLAB, and git in my research and enjoy developing statistical models. 
My interests include machine learning, wearable devices, and running injury, which I'm combining to quantify stress fracture risk in collegiate cross country runners. 

### What am I up to?
I'm currently a Biomechanics PhD candidate at the University of Colorado Boulder in Dr. Alena Grabowski's [Applied Biomechanics Laboratory](https://www.colorado.edu/iphy/research/applied-biomechanics-lab). 
My general research interests include footwear biomechanics, running-related injuries, and sprinting mechanics. Check out some of the 
[projects](https://alcantarar.github.io/projects/) I've been working on or [follow me](https://twitter.com/Ryan_Alcantara_) on twitter!
<br>    
I've become interested in research software, developing [dryft](https://github.com/alcantarar/dryft#dryft), an open source python/MATLAB package to process force-measuring treadmill data. I also recently led a [Git/GitHub workshop for researchers](https://www.ryan-alcantara.com/projects/p90_Github_Tutorial_for_researchers/) at the 2020 American Society of Biomechanics annual meeting.
<br>    
When I'm not working, I enjoy running, snowboarding, playing Dungeons & Dragons, and helping researchers with their programming problems.
