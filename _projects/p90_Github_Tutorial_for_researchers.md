At the 2020 ASB Conference, I lead a tutorial introducing
Git and GitHub as version control tools for researchers. 
With the help of [Gary Bruening](https://github.com/gbruening),
[Ross Wilkinson](https://twitter.com/rd_wilkinson),
and [Steve Kasica](https://github.com/swkasica), we
created an interactive tutorial where attendees
learned the basic concepts of version control with
Git and practiced collaborating on a coding project
in small groups via GitHub. The tutorial has example
scripts that can be run in either MATLAB, Python, and R. 
Sixty attendees registered for the event, but with hundreds
on the waitlist, we recorded the talk and provided the 
following resources that can be used in conjunction with the 
embedded recording to walk through the tutorial on your 
own or with a small group:

* [All tutorial materials](https://github.com/alcantarar/asb_tutorial).
* [PDF of slides](https://github.com/alcantarar/ASB_Tutorial/tree/master/presentation_slides)
* [Breakout 1 Instructions](https://github.com/alcantarar/ASB_Tutorial/blob/master/Tutorial_Instructions/breakout_1.md)
* [Breakout 2 Instructions](https://github.com/alcantarar/ASB_Tutorial/blob/master/Tutorial_Instructions/breakout_2.md)
* [Git Cheat Sheet](https://github.com/alcantarar/ASB_Tutorial/blob/master/Tutorial_Instructions/git_cheatsheet.md)
* [Q&A and Additional Resources](https://github.com/alcantarar/ASB_Tutorial/blob/master/Q_and_A.md)

If you have any questions or just want to chat about
version control, reach out via email or Twitter! Thanks
to the American Society for Biomechanics for letting me
host a tutorial and everyone who made it possible, 
either in the months of preparation or the day-of 
execution.
