PubMed has an API that you can use to access their database of research articles!
<br>  
I modified python code from a blog post by [Marco Bonzanini](https://marcobonzanini.com/2015/01/12/searching-pubmed-with-python/) to search PubMed for Biomechanics-related research articles. It prints out a bibliography in GitHub markdown format that contains the matching research papers with hyperlinks to their page on PubMed.

The script and instructions on how to change search terms or date range can be found at my [literature_update repository](https://github.com/alcantarar/literature_update)
