title: "Stroller Running: Energetic and kinematic changes across pushing methods"

excerpt: 'Running with a stroller provides an opportunity for parents to exercise near their child and counteract health declines experienced during early parenthood. Three commonly used stroller pushing methods were investigated to detect potential changes in energetic cost and lower-limb kinematics.'

We also developed an interactive tool to calculate metabolic energy expenditure depending on what pushing method you use during stroller running: [Stroller Running Calculator](https://public.tableau.com/views/StrollerRunningCost_1/Stroller_Cost?:embed=y&:display_count=yes&:showTabs=y&:showVizHome=no)
