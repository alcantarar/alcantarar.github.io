# Models for the pathogenesis of stress fractures in athletes
[Bennell, Malcolm, Wark, and Brukner 1996](../References/Bennell1996Models.pdf)


Solid review. A lot of references to check out later. 

#### Bone notes
- Frost's threshold for microdamage threshold: 2k microstrains (upper range of physiological values) citation \#40
- lower bone density as a risk: citations 25 26 32 33
- limitation of crack propogation (geometry): citation 54
- targeted bone repair: citatiosn 22 33 42 46 47 50 52 54

#### Role of Muscle
- may depend on the location of the fracture:
- muscle causes increased bone strain at attachment sites: citation 66 67
- muscles attenuate forces: citation 68, 69, 70
- bigger calf muscles protect the tibia: 72 (military), 73 (female athletes)

#### Model for pathogenesis
2 models, not necessarily exclusive: Microdamage then targeted remodeling OR remodeling naturally occurs, weakens bone pre-osteoblast activity,
and microdamage occurs in this location. Either way, if microdamage rates > repair, stress fracture occurs:
