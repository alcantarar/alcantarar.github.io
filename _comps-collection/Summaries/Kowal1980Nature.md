# Nature and causes of injuries in women resulting from an endurance training program
[Kowal 1980](../References/Kowal1980Nature.pdf)

### Summary Notes:
Prospective, 400 female military recruits went through an 8-week military training program.
215 (54%) reported an injury, 45 were tibial stress fracture, 20 hip/femoral head, 8 foot stress fracture:  34% of all 
injuries were stress fractures. Focus definitely appears to be on the training regimen. 

### Study Design:
- 8-week training program (1hr a day, 5-6 days/week running/marching; progressed from 3/4 mile to 2 miles (10-9min/mile pace))
- initial assessment of body comp, vo2 max, prior physical fitness questionnaire
- injury defined as requiring medical attention. 
### Results:
54% of women sustained some sort of injury (34% of injuries were stress fractures)
**Initial assessment results** between injured and uninjured:
- Injured had ~0.7% more body fat
- 4.5 ml/kg min lower Vo2 max
- scored similar in weight, height, leg strength, prior physical activity/fitness.

##### Stress Fractures over time: 
- tibial stress fracture incidence peaked during the middle of training
- femoral/hip stress fracture incidence increased over time (*see figure below*)

##### Men vs Women
- 17% more stress fractures in women than men (table 2)

##### "Discriminant analysis" contributing to prediction of injured group (55% success rate):
*Level of significance might be why prediction accuracy was low...*

### Discussion: 
Authors blame continued training when hurt, structural weakness, and "biomechanical anomaly", but don't really have much
data to back these up. Also mention how
the standard military boot doesn't fit women's feet well and causes heel instability. Also women's apparent "inability to 
differentiuate between 'pushing themselves' beyond the pain threshold and exposing themselves to undue risk of injury". I 
would imagine there is quite a bit of pressure to push yourself in basic training, especially if you're a woman in the late '70s.

Author returns to the training program, which may have been too much, too soon:
>*Initially, the bones attempt to become stronger by remodeling their internal architecture in response to the chronic physical demand. 
>In doing so, they actually become weaker in the area of mechanical stress, and continued training during this period may 
>have led to injury. The second phase of this remodeling involves actual deposition and hypertrophy of the bone along 
>the lines of stress. However, during the lag time between these two phases, the bone is also more susceptible to fracture 
>(Provost & Morris (1969) Fatigue fractures of the femoral shaft.*

In 1919 (Health in the Army), women had basically twice the stress fracture rate as men (19.6 vs 9.4 per 1000). Appears
to happen more with overweight and less physically active people (men and women). 

Prior work has found that training 3 days a week with 1 day of legit rest between improved injury rates (Tomasi et al. 1977 
Women's response to Army training)

First mention of stress fractures having a "multidimensional nature". Early detection and rest is still the solution in 1980 (and 2019).
