# On insufficiency fractures of femur and tibia
[Hansson 1938](../References/Hansson1938Insufficiency.pdf)

### Summary
- Paper connecting "march fractures" to tibial/femoral/metatarsal "insufficiency fractures". Refers to **Aleman**, the oldest
confirmed reference to stress fractures I've been able to find. 

- Clarifies that it's not just inflamation of the periostium, but damage to the bone, not just the membrane. 
Observable thanks to the new technology of x-rays!

Interesting that folks who got shin splints or stress fractures may have thought they had a tumor on their bone! Also cool
to think about this paper using radiology to diagnose stress fractures only 37 years after Roentgen won the Nobel Prize in 
physics in 1901 for his first x-ray (although Nikola Tesla may have done it sooner).
