# Evaluation of lower extremity overuse injury potential in runners
[Hreljac, Marshall, & Hume 2000](../References/Hreljac2000Evaluation.pdf)

### Notes
compared injured vs uninjured groups and found differences in peak impact and loading rate. not stress fracture specific, 
but focused on injuries of knee and lower extremities. injured group = ever had an injury (retrospective).
### Purpose
see what biomechanical variables might contribute to injuries in runners. But taking the approach that no particular
anatomical or biomechanical problems result in specific injuries. So, not stress fracture specific.
### Methods
Two groups of 20 runners, one that had never had a running injury, and another who had suffered at least one overuse 
injury at the knee or lower.
This seems to be a pretty loose definition...

- Had all subjects run over a force plate at 4 m/s with mocap. Measured a lot of biomechanical variables:
    - contact time
    - impact peak
    - loading rate
    - active peak
    - peak propulsive
    - achilles angle @ touchdown (thinking tendinopathy )
    - peak pronation
    - change in achilles angle
    - peak pronation velocity


### Results
Impact peak was greater in injured group (2.4BW vs 2.13BW) and Loading rate was larger (93 Bw/s vs 77 BW/s)
Impact Loading as a culprit was hypothesized by references 4 17 30 31 37, but now experimentally tested.

### Discussion
recommendations: run slower to reduce impact loading (peak and loading rate).
