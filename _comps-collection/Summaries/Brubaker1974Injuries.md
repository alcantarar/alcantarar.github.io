# Injuries to runners
### [Brubaker & James 1974](../References/Brubaker1974Injuries.pdf)

Overview of prevalence and anatomical site of stress fractures pulled from a Eugene othropaedic clinic's database, consisting of
 mostly runners from the University of Oregon, Oregon State University and Eugene high schools from 1955-1972. **109** 
 cases of stress fracture were included from a total of 4850 records.
 
 Categorical variables: 
 - Runner's competitive events
    - sprint: < 440yd, middle: 440-mile, distance: > mile.
 - type of injury
 - treatment
 - disposition of injury (outcome)
 
 17 (15.6% of total injuries) were reported as stress fractures, with 12 of them being middle/long distance. Table III has 
 the breakdown of fracture type (41% tibia, but see distance runner 3rd met combination):

Treatment was mostly Rest, with some PT, and the most popular treatment duration was 3-8 weeks (8 of 17 cases) but 3 out of 
17 cases required 1-3 weeks or 2-6 months. Good news is that everyone seemed to recover from them with all cases resulting
in a "good" - "apparently good" disposition. 

Compared to joggers, these **competitive runners have more incidence of stress fractures** (1% (per Glick and Katch 1970) vs 16%).

They suspect (I think reasonably so) that different mechanisms may be responsible for fractures at different locations.
