# Stress Fractures in 51 Runners
[Sullivan et al 1984](../References/Sullivan1984Stress.pdf)

### Notes
- Emphasis has been on physical examinations (anatomical risk factors), but this paper does touch on training load
a bit more than other studies. Focus is on just runners, but outcomes are limited. 

### Methods
51 runners, mostly high school track/XC runners. Most ran more than 20 miles a week.

### Results
- First to really emphasize history, as 7 runners had previously had stress fractures treated. 
- 31 had modified training in some way prior to injury (mostly increase in mileage). 
Injury occurred w/i 12 weeks of change.
- 19 runners with flat feet (pes planus) developed stress fractures. 
### Discussion
First I've seen of the 10% increase per week "rule": 
>The 20-miles-per-week runner would be wise not to increase his distance by more than two miles per week; the
>80-miles-per-week runner may sustain a larger increase.

- six weeks of rest should cure most patients.
