# Overuse Injuries in athletes: A perspective
[Stanish 1984](../References/Stanish1984Overuse.pdf)

### Notes
I think this piece does a decent job at summarizing the general attitude towards overuse injuries. While the focus
wasn't specifically on stress fractures, a large part of overuse injuries are stress fractures, so it received significant
attention. In the '70s and '80s, there were two schools of thought in terms of what might be more responsible for stress 
fractures: Impact forces (affected by shoes, surfaces, muscle fatigue) or muscle forces (bone bending). Impact forces
has received WAY more attention, perhaps due to the more tangible means of interventions ("wear more cushioning shoes").
Biomechanics is starting to become a more common topic though, what used to be "alignment" is now overpronation or flat feet,
more specifically. 

In the '80s', I'm starting to see more of a focus on training load (especially in military studies), but with mixed
results. 

Some fun sound bites out of this piece:

>All humans need stress in order to survive.

On humans, horses, and greyhounds getting stress fractures:
>The common denominator in this group is that these are the only species who train at maximum effort despite pain.
>The enthusiasm of the human spriit may well be at the root of the overuse and abuse problem.

On telling runners not to run because of injury:
>The simplist and most logical approach to the problem of overuse would obviously be rest and abstention from these 
>activities. If the runner has pain after jogging only 6 km, he could be told not to jog. [...] While this may seem like
>the most direct route, it is flawed in two basic regards. First, the athlete, young or old, will not accept this 
>prescription. They want to, almost need to, participate and, despite what they are told, will return to their sport and
>rely on other medical counsel. Second, history has dictated the evil effects of inactivity, both physically and psychologically.
>Mark Twain once pointed out that if he gave up smoking, he may not live any longer, but it would certainly seem like
>he had.

On the cumulative loading a 68kg man will experience during running:
>... the total impact load increases to 200,00 kg an increase of more than 73% [compared to walking]. The cumulative
>effect of this increase over 80-96 km per week is awesome.

On the increased incidence of injury in runners:
>Sport scientists and medical practitioners have demonstrated great concern because of this obvious carnage.
