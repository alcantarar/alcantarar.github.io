# Tibial Stress Injuries
## An Aetiological Review for the Purposes of Guiding Management
[Beck 1998](../References/Beck1998Tibial.pdf)

### Notes

### Purpose
Review the evidence and theory behind "chronic tibial bending" (almost 200 papers)
- some bending papers: citations 11 12 14 18 19

#### Bone Geometry
>As bones are curved, compressive loads applied at the
joint surfaces rarely act through the centre of the
bone and, thus, bending occurs.[25] Long bones
with narrow diaphyseal widths will bend to a
greater extent when loaded than those with wider
diaphyses.[26,27]
>



#### Muscle Loads
> Bowerman (not Bill :sad:) quote: "... stress fractures can occur as a result of... repeated contractions of the muscles of the lower leg" (pg 131)
>[107]

- Lanyon et al [97] thought tibial deformations were a combination of muscle tension and bodyweight.
- Muscle contracting in opposition to tensile loads (or bending moment) in bone:
    - citations # 8, 112-118
    
#### Eversion/Pronation
>In the broadest sense, hyperpronation has been
associated with an increased incidence of ‘shin
splints’ in general,[131] and tibial stress injuries
more specifically. [22,24,83,127,132-135]
Indeed, in runners who hyperpronate, the transmission of force
up the leg has been found to be exaggerated.[127]
The velocity of pronation may also be a risk factor
for tibial injury.[131]
