# Stress Fractures in Athletes
[Hulkko & Orava 1987](../References/Hulkko1987Stress.pdf)

### Notes
another incidence paper/review

- women were affected more than men (younger women even moreso) but no explanation are explored
- throwers can get olecranon stress fractures
- Idea of "skeletal conditioning" where Scully 1982 inserted a rest week partway through military training. Theoretically
provided time for the bone to sufficiently remodel/rebuild.
