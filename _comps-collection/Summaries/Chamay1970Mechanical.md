# Mechanical and morphological aspects of experimental overlaod and fatigue in bone
[Chamay 1970](../References/Chamay1970Mechanical.pdf)

### Notes
- "Slip lines"  is a term used to explain deformation of bone along the direction of high shear stress.
-  when compressing bone, there's a period of elastic deformation (reversible) followed by plastic deformation 
(only partially reversible) (Dempster & Liddicoat 1952)

### Purpose
- Apply compressive forces to dog ulnas and see when slip lines/fractures develop. 
- Make a qualitative force-deformation curve for dog ulnas.

### Methods
- 30 pairs of dog ulnas, no muscles, stored in freezer. "fresh and moist" bones.
- applied compressive force using an old-school materials testing machine. 
- Tested ulnas in pairs: one compressed to failure, other underwent a cyclical fatigue test
- Observations were made with electron microscope

### Mechanically Loading Bone
Multiple "zones" of bone loading: 
1. **Zone of Load** Where deformation is mostly linear, elastic, and follows Hooke's Law. No amount of cyclical loading will cause a fracture
or permanent deformation (plastic), a closed hysteresis loop. *But if I applied a small force fast enough and long enough, would a stress fracture occur?*
1. **Zone of Fatigue** Where the curve increases (less deformation per unit force). slightly open loop, enough cycles will cause a right shift
towards plastic deformation. 
1. **Zone of Overload** deformation drastically increases per unit force until fracture.

*In this instance, microfractures develop in the compressed cortex, progressively weakening the bone. **P** was around 1-1.5BW,
Zone of fatigue was 0.8-1.2BW.*

### Discussion
I guess there is probably a point where bone repair does outpace the loads you impose on a bone. I guess I just thought 
that the **Zone of Fatigue** is a bit bigger. Also, the authors suggest that a dog running is in the zone of overload and 
that the bone "does not have time to resume its final form before a new force is applied to it". Could muscles help return 
a bone to it's original shape between steps? Like dorsiflexion during swing?
