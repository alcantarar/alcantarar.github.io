# Musculoskeletal Injuries in Jogging
[Glick & Katch 1970](../References/Glick1970Musculoskeletal.pdf)

### Notes

120 adults underwent an 11-week jogging program. Don't know what the program was though. 

Stress fractures in the Fibula happen. Devas & Sweetnam (1956) foudn 50 cases of fibular stress fractures in runners. 
Maybe not as common as tibial stress fractures, but they happen. The 1 person in this study with bilateral fibular 
stress fractures took 3-4 weeks off (one leg had to be casted though) and they healed up.
